As many carmakers are working through challenges with the\\nunit economics of their EV programs, we aim to leverage our position as a cost\\nleader. We are focused on rapidly growing production, investments in autonomy\\nand vehicle software, and remaining on track with our growth investments.\\nOur near-term pricing strategy considers a long-term view on per vehicle\\nprofitability given the potential lifetime value of a Tesla vehicle through autonomy,\\nsupercharging, connectivity and service. We expect that our product pricing will\\ncontinue to evolve, upwards or downwards, depending on a number of factors.\\nAlthough we implemented price reductions on many vehicle models across regions\\nin the first quarter, our operating margins reduced at a manageable rate. We\\nexpect ongoing cost reduction of our vehicles, including improved production\\nefficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and remain focused on\\noperating leverage as we scale.\\nWe are rapidly growing energy storage production capacity at our Megafactory in\\nLathrop and we recently announced a new Megafactory in Shanghai. We are also\\ncontinuing to execute on our product roadmap, including Cybertruck, our next\\ngeneration vehicle platform, autonomy and other AI enabled products.\\nOur balance sheet and net income enable us to continue to make these capital\\nexpenditures in line with our future growth.

N\\nWEBCAST INFORMATION\\nTesla will provide a live webcast of its first quarter 2023 financial results conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. CT on April 19, 2023 at ir.tesla.com. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year\\nthereafter.\\nCERTAIN TERMS\\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product\\ndeployment volume includes both customer units installed and equipment sales; we report installations at time of commissioning for storage projects or inspection for solar projects, and equipment sales at time of delivery.\\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c) depreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based\\ncompensation expense, which is the same measurement for this term pursuant to the performance-based stock option award granted to our CEO in 2018. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average\\ncost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries (excluding leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied\\nby (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of\\nsupply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD\\nusing average exchange rates from the prior period.\\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income\\n(loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss)\\nattributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as\\nwell as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information\\ninternally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial\\ncondition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s\\nperformance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding\\nTesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided above.\\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future development, ramp, production capacity, efficiency and output rates, supply chain, demand and market growth,\\ncost, pricing and profitability, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck,\\nTesla Semi, our next generation vehicle platform, our Autopilot, Full Self-Driving and other vehicle software and AI enabled products, our battery cells, our Supercharging network and our energy storage and solar products;\\nstatements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and statements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” that are\\nsubject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected.\\nThe following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and regulatory conditions arising from the\\ncurrent global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage\\nthis growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifically; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to\\nmanage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery\\ncells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the\\nautomotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of\\ngovernment and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel and ramp our installation teams; our ability to maintain the security of\\nour information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and\\nfinancing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and\\nreports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 31, 2023. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these\\nforward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\\n28\\n\\n=== [PAGE 29] ==='"

       "- Structure financière (dette, liquide pleins) : Tesla a un grand montant de liquidité de 22,402M$ avec des investissements et des comptes courants, ainsi qu'une solide trésorerie de 22,4M$. La maison mère a lui-même moins de 600M$ de dette.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Risques & incertitudes (marché, réglementation, changement) : L'industrie de l'électromobilité et l'électricité continue à être influencée par de nombreux facteurs tels que la concurrence, les réglementations et les fluctuations des prix de l'or et du nickel. Tesla est également vulnérable aux fluctuations de la demande en raison des fluctuations des prix du gaz à court terme.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Outlook / Guidance (si communiqué) : Tesla estime que ses ventes et son environnement financial sont fort en partie grâce à une croissance rapide de la demande pour les batteries énergie, alors que l'entreprise a engagé la construction d'une nouvelle fabrication dans son centre d'innovation de l'énergie à Shanghai.\n",
